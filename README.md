#C++ "Register"

An obfuscated code snippet for demonstration.

It includes:
- Obscure keywords,
- Insane nested macros that do nothing,
- Useless, overly specified keywords.

##Disclaimer
This is literally worst practice, I've included a compiled file that runs on linux but feel free to try this compile yourself. Make sure to use C++23 but you have a great chance that you can't compile this shit.

##Usage

Run:
`g++ -o main register.cpp`
`./main`
